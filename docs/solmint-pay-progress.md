# SolMint Pay — Engineering Progress Ledger

This file is the durable project checkpoint for Pay work. Update it when a major gate is completed so later work does not repeat an already-validated stage.

## 2026-09-14 — Devnet E2E blocker closed

Status: **COMPLETED**

Merged PR: `#79`

Merge commit on `main`: `4f261f3173ba3948fb2f607c9762edb9ef059d5d`

Scope: stabilize the real Solana Devnet payment E2E path and transaction observation.

Validated before merge:

- Dedicated Devnet CI funding wallet is configured through GitHub Secret `DEVNET_E2E_FUNDER_SECRET_KEY_B64`; the private-key value is not stored in this document.
- Funder key material validation and public-key consistency validation passed.
- Real Devnet payment submission reached the verification path.
- Memo/reference account is a signer in the real E2E transaction construction.
- Funding, submission, observation, discovery and verification use the dedicated Devnet RPC path rather than an unreliable public faucet/RPC fallback.
- RPC transaction observation now first requires finalized signature status, then may use confirmed transaction details only to tolerate provider-side transaction-detail indexing lag. Effective finality is not downgraded by this fallback.
- `SolMint Pay Devnet E2E` passed.
- CI passed.
- Production Build passed.
- SolMint Pay Mainnet Read-only passed.
- SolMint Pay Production API Smoke passed.

Conclusion: the long-running **Devnet E2E funding/transaction-observation blocker is closed and must not be re-investigated unless a new regression appears**.

## 2026-09-14 — Production API origin gate closed

Status: **COMPLETED**

Merged PR: `#81`

Validated:

- Production Pages configuration contains the real `PAY_APP_ORIGIN` value used by the authenticated Pay API origin check.
- Production API smoke was rerun after deployment and passed.
- The earlier `403 ORIGIN_FORBIDDEN` result was a pre-deployment/stale-environment observation and is not the current production blocker.

## 2026-09-14 — Repository migration history reconciliation

Status: **COMPLETED**

Merged PR: `#82`

Merge commit on `main`: `16e8dfaf51a948920e1375f04db969d0fc86a411`

Scope: reconcile the repository migration chain with the live Production migration ledger without mutating the live database, and establish a preview-free validation path.

Live database evidence used for reconciliation:

- Live Supabase project: `nvopkbiedorfshwbmyhn`.
- Production migration ledger reports **69 applied migration versions**, from `20260829090000` through `20260911061000`.
- Repository migration history was reconstructed from the live ledger and verified historical Git sources.
- The live database was **not** migration-repaired or otherwise mutated by this repository-only reconciliation.
- The incorrect local `20260905000100` mapping was corrected; `20260905000200` and `20260905000300` were restored.
- The seven Better Auth migrations were restored under the exact production-recorded timestamp/name mapping.
- The non-live root migration `20260906000001` was removed from the active chain in favor of the live `20260906135730` migration.

### Preview-free decision

Status: **COMMITTED PROJECT CONSTRAINT**

The project will not depend on Supabase Preview Branching/Preview Database for Pay delivery.

The maintainer does not have access to a credit card and cannot use a paid Supabase Pro/Branching environment. This is a delivery constraint, not a security exception. Production database/RLS remains authoritative.

### Preview-free validation path

1. Keep the production migration ledger as the source of truth for the applied migration history.
2. Validate the repository migration chain in GitHub CI.
3. Run Pay database security/adversarial SQL against isolated disposable PostgreSQL in CI.
4. Run CI/typecheck/unit tests and Production Build.
5. Reuse the already-validated dedicated Devnet E2E and Mainnet read-only/runtime smoke paths for blockchain behavior.
6. Never use a public RPC/faucet fallback as a production test assumption.
7. Do not run `supabase migration repair` against production unless a later explicit, evidence-backed reconciliation requires it.

The preview-free migration gate is an integrity/reproducibility check. It does not claim plain PostgreSQL is equivalent to Supabase Preview.

### Migration-chain gate repair

The first CI implementation **failed correctly** by detecting six stale/duplicate Better Auth/identity filenames in the branch while the canonical production names were missing. The test was not weakened.

A second issue in the new gate was also corrected: version-boundary comparison now uses numeric 14-digit migration timestamps so newer pending migrations are not rejected accidentally.

The migration lineage was then corrected using verified historical blobs: the exact production names are restored, redundant unsuffixed files are removed, and the strictly newer repository migration `20260911103000_pay_webhook_read_projection.sql` remains as an explicit pending migration because it is newer than the current Production ledger boundary.

### Final validation evidence

- `SolMint Pay Database Security` #283 — **GREEN**: migration-chain integrity, identity/RLS security, and API-key lifecycle security all passed.
- `CI` #2100 — **GREEN**: typecheck, production build, unit tests, and source-tree invariant all passed.
- `Production Build` #1778 — **GREEN**.
- Cloudflare Pages preview deployment for the final PR head — **successful**.
- Repository code search found no remaining references to the removed legacy identity migration filename.
- PR #82 was merged successfully as `16e8dfaf51a948920e1375f04db969d0fc86a411`.

This checkpoint is now **completed**. The live Production database remains unchanged by this PR.

## Next unreleased Pay gate

Move to **authenticated merchant lifecycle and production-safe merchant credentials** (Issue #68 acceptance path).

The next implementation/audit cycle must verify these real server-mediated contracts end-to-end against authentication, authorization/merchant isolation, idempotency, and deployment/runtime evidence before expanding the UI surface:

- merchant read/create
- wallet challenge/verification
- API-key list/create/revoke/rotate
- Payment Intent read

## Explicitly not complete yet

Do not mark Pay production-ready. Remaining release gates include the authenticated production merchant path with a controlled account, wallet ownership lifecycle evidence, API credential authorization E2E, controlled non-production Payment Intent lifecycle, adversarial verification cases, final release audit, and branch-protection enforcement.

## Working rule

Before starting a new Pay task:

1. Read this ledger and the master specification.
2. Check the current `main` HEAD and relevant CI evidence.
3. Revalidate the real backend/database contract for the requested capability.
4. Never repeat the Devnet funding/observation work unless CI demonstrates a regression.
5. Do not add Supabase Preview Branching as a prerequisite for Pay delivery.
